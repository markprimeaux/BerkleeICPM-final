Synopsis

This is the page I am creating for my final project. I intend to catalog some of my favorite albums in my collection.

TO-DO

1. Add albums and other data to 'primeauxAlbums' postgreSQL database for albums. 
2. Code js to iterate through the albums and create cover art images on the page. When clicked, the code will display data from the db on the page.
3. Add any CSS to make the page look nice.
