Synopsis

The idea for my final project was to have a page that displayed some of my
favorite albums from a database that stored the information about those albums,
and upon clicking the album art, return the information in an alert.
I also wanted to create a form to submit new albums, and have those albums
inserted into the database and displayed on the page.

I have succeeded in both of these tasks, but there are a few bugs:
1. When submitting a URL, it must only one segment in the path.
   i.e.: https://somewebsite.com/lsdkflasf. I would like to find a way to be
   able to submit any website with any number of segments.
2. When submitting the form, the URL does not redirect back to
   localhost:4001/albums.hmtl. I will need to do more research into how to get this
   to work.

Overall, I am happy with the way this project turned out. It would be nice to
have some CSS to make the site look nicer. I will look into that at a later time.
